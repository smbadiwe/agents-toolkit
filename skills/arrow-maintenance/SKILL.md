# Arrow Maintenance

The arrow-maintenance overlay scales linked-intent-dev for projects too large to hold in one context window. It provides a navigation index, systematic audit, and brownfield bootstrap.

This skill operates in **two modes**. Detect which mode applies before acting.

## Two modes

**Ambient mode.** Auto-triggered on arrow-adjacent prompts when `docs/arrows/` exists. Posture is *catch and recommend* — notice relevant work, surface findings, edit only as the surrounding conversation authorizes. File writes happen opportunistically (e.g., updating an arrow doc's coverage table alongside a linked-intent-dev edit on the same segment). Do not initiate a systematic audit-and-update pass in ambient mode.

**Command mode.** Invoked explicitly as `/arrow-maintenance`. Posture is *directed action* — the user has asked for the pass. Run an audit-and-update pass, apply unambiguous fixes in place, and surface the rest for user decision. Does not pause at synthetic phase boundaries — it is a single directed pass.

## When `/arrow-maintenance` is invoked

Inspect the project and dispatch on state:

- **Overlay present (`docs/arrows/` exists)** → run the audit-and-update pass (below).
- **LID docs present (HLD + at least one LLD) but no `docs/arrows/`** → generate the overlay from existing LID docs: populate `index.yaml` with one `arrows:` entry per existing LLD, status `MAPPED`, `sampled: {today}`, `audited_sha: null`; create one per-segment arrow doc per LLD referencing the existing LLD and any known tests/code. Do not generate new HLD, LLD, or EARS skeletons (those exist).
- **Neither LID docs nor overlay** → the user typed `/arrow-maintenance` on a project that isn't ready for it. Don't just print a redirect — describe what you found and offer to dispatch: "I see no LID installation here. You probably want `/lid-setup` if this is a greenfield project, or `/map-codebase` if you're bringing LID to an existing codebase. Shall I run one of those instead, or did you mean something else?" Then proceed based on the user's answer.

## Audit-and-update pass (command mode)

Every `/arrow-maintenance` run, in order:

1. **Repair broken overlay state.** Malformed `index.yaml`, missing per-segment docs referenced by the index, stale schema versions — these are this skill's domain, so fix them first.

2. **Run the five audit checks** (see `references/audit-checklist.md`):
   - **Reference coherence**: do arrow-doc pointers resolve? Are cited EARS specs present? Are LLD section headings as referenced?
   - **Coverage**: does every behavioral spec have at least one eval assertion citing it?
   - **Staleness**: compare `audited` and `audited_sha` against current state to find segments whose files changed since last audit.
   - **Drift signals**: modified code since `audited_sha`, specs changed without test updates, tests passing but missing `@spec` annotations, `@spec` annotations pointing to missing spec IDs (*reverse orphans*).
   - **Orphan artifacts**: LLDs, specs, or code files not listed in any arrow doc's References section.

   When a project-local coherence script is declared under `## LID Tooling` in `CLAUDE.md` (as `Coherence check: {path}`), invoke that script and treat its output as authoritative for the deterministic checks it performs. Languages and paths vary by project — trust the declaration. If the declaration is missing or the declared path does not exist, perform the checks in-prompt. A reference Node implementation is bundled at `references/coherence-check.mjs` that users may copy to their project and declare in CLAUDE.md.

3. **Apply unambiguous fixes in place:**
   - Regenerate `## Spec Coverage` tables in affected arrow docs from source scans.
   - Regenerate `## References` sections from source scans (grep for `@spec`, check file paths exist).
   - Update `status` / `next` / `drift` fields in `index.yaml` where the new state is clear.
   - Clean up `unmapped.docs`: assign entries to segments where the assignment is unambiguous; flag the rest for user assignment.
   - Refresh `audited: {today}` and `audited_sha: {current git HEAD}` on each audited segment.

4. **Surface everything else for user decision:**
   - Reverse orphans — ask whether to create the missing spec, delete the annotation, or treat as an alias of an existing spec. Do not auto-resolve.
   - Ambiguous segment assignments for `unmapped.docs` entries.
   - Candidate lifecycle events (splits, merges) detected from drift signals.
   - Any finding where the right fix depends on intent.

5. **Produce a structured report** at the end: list findings, distinguishing those that were automatically resolved from those requiring user decision. Include location (segment, file, line) for each.

## Incremental audit

When `audited_sha` is populated and git history is available, run the audit in incremental mode — inspect only segments whose files changed since `audited_sha`. This is a large performance win on big projects. When `audited_sha` is null (never audited) or git history is unavailable, audit every segment.

## Ambient mode behavior

When the skill is consulted ambiently (not via `/arrow-maintenance`), bias the agent's work on arrow-adjacent tasks:

- **Start from `index.yaml`.** Load it first, before any per-segment doc. Query for unblocked segments (where `blockedBy` is empty and `status` is not `OK` or `OBSOLETE`).
- **Load detail on demand.** Only load the per-segment arrow doc once a specific segment is implied. Follow its `## References` into LLDs, spec files, tests, or code as needed.
- **Surface drift rather than silently repair.** When you notice a reference mismatch, reverse orphan, or stale segment during other work, mention it. Let the user or `linked-intent-dev` drive the fix.
- **Participate in writes the conversation is already doing.** When `linked-intent-dev` is editing a segment, update that segment's arrow doc and `index.yaml` entry in the same cascade — this is opportunistic, not initiated by you.

## Authoritative sources

When information appears in multiple places, this is the authority rule:

- **Segment state fields** (`status`, `sampled`, `audited`, `audited_sha`, `next`, `drift`, `blocks`, `blockedBy`, `merged_into`) live authoritatively in `index.yaml`.
- **Per-segment arrow doc's References and Spec Coverage** are *derived views* — regenerated from source scans during audit. Do not hand-edit them to contradict source.
- **`index.yaml` schema** is defined in `references/index-schema.md` (and in `docs/llds/arrow-maintenance.md`).
- **Spec-file header format** (the LID-on-LID inversion) is defined in `docs/llds/linked-intent-dev.md` — this skill reads from that schema.
- **`@spec` placement rule** (entry point of behavior's implementation graph) is defined in the `linked-intent-dev` skill.

## Arrow doc format

Each segment has one markdown file in `docs/arrows/{segment-name}.md`. See `references/arrow-doc-template.md` for the template. The arrow doc is an *orientation page*, not a design doc — pointers + coverage table, no duplicated design content.

## Status enum

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| UNMAPPED | Not yet explored |
| MAPPED | Structure known, specs not verified against code |
| AUDITED | Specs verified — implementation status understood |
| OK | Fully coherent — all specs implemented |
| PARTIAL | Some specs missing or partial |
| BROKEN | Code and docs have diverged significantly |
| STALE | Docs exist but outdated |
| OBSOLETE | Superseded, kept for historical reference |
| MERGED | Combined into another arrow (use `merged_into` field) |

Normal progression: `UNMAPPED → MAPPED → AUDITED → OK`.

## Lifecycle events

Segments evolve. Four first-class events:

- **Split**: one segment → two. Create the new segment's arrow doc, move relevant references, update both docs to reference each other, record in `index.yaml`. If detected mid-change, ask whether to split now or defer — deferring is preferred. Split at clean breaks, not mid-edit.
- **Merge**: two segments → one. Pick primary, move references, mark secondary as `MERGED` with `merged_into: {primary-name}`. Tombstone or delete the secondary's arrow doc.
- **Rename**: name changes (e.g., `auth` → `identity`). Walk *all* cross-references atomically in the same session: arrow-doc filename, `index.yaml` entry key, `blocks`, `blockedBy`, `merged_into`, `taxonomy` membership, and every other arrow doc's References section. Rename is not rename-and-hope; update every reference in one pass.
- **Status transition**: `UNMAPPED → MAPPED → AUDITED → OK` with detours as needed. Timestamps (`sampled`, `audited`, `audited_sha`) record when each transition happened.

## Coordination with linked-intent-dev

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Per-change HLD/LLD/EARS/test/code work | linked-intent-dev |
| Cascade at change time | linked-intent-dev |
| Arrow doc + `index.yaml` updates *during* a change | linked-intent-dev (has segment in context) |
| `unmapped.docs` cleanup | arrow-maintenance during audit; linked-intent-dev when it notices an unmapped doc it can assign in passing |
| Systematic audit across segments | arrow-maintenance |
| Drift detection between sessions | arrow-maintenance |
| Brownfield mapping | arrow-maintenance (`/map-codebase`) |
| Overlay bootstrap on existing LID projects | arrow-maintenance (`/arrow-maintenance` command mode) |
| Lifecycle events (split, merge, rename, status) | Either skill; arrow-maintenance has richer guidance for multi-segment events and renames |

## No prescribed audit cadence

The skill does not prescribe "run audit every N commits" or "run weekly." Surface staleness signals when consulted; let the user choose the rhythm.
